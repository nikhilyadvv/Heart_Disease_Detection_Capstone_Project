# DATASET OVERVIEW

In a dataset for heart disease detection, the variables represent different attributes related to the patients. Here's what each of these variables typically represents:

- age: Age of the patient.
- sex: Gender of the patient. (1 = male; 0 = female)
- cp: Chest pain type. It's categorical data, where:
  1 = typical angina
  2 = atypical angina
  3 = non-anginal pain
  4 = asymptomatic
- trestbps: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg) upon admission to the hospital.
- chol: Serum cholesterol level (in mg/dl).
- fbs: Fasting blood sugar level > 120 mg/dl. (1 = true; 0 = false)
- restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results. It's categorical data, where:
  0 = normal
  1 = having ST-T wave abnormality
  2 = showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria
- thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved.
- exang: Exercise induced angina. (1 = yes; 0 = no)
- oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
- slope: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment. It's categorical data, where:
  1 = upsloping
  2 = flat
  3 = downsloping
- ca: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy.
- thal: Thalassemia. It's categorical data, where:
  1 = normal
  2 = fixed defect
  3 = reversible defect
- target: The presence of heart disease. (1 = yes; 0 = no)
